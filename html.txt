<p>Dear&nbsp;<strong>Dr. {name}</strong>,<br /><br /> My name is Joel Joseph and I am currently in my junior year at the&nbsp;<strong>Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi</strong>&nbsp;India. I am also an undergraduate researcher at the&nbsp;<strong>Robotics Research Center</strong>&nbsp;at my college.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /> I am hoping for the possibility of doing a&nbsp;<strong>Research Internship</strong>&nbsp;under your guidance during the&nbsp;<strong>summer of 2020</strong>&nbsp;in order to gain experience in the field of&nbsp;<strong>Computer Vision</strong>&nbsp;and help extend the state of the art.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /> As a Computer Vision and Robotics enthusiast, I have worked on various projects based on Deep Learning, Image Processing and IoT. My ongoing work at IIT Varanasi with&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hprabhatgupta/home">Dr. Hariprabhat Gupta</a>&nbsp;involves making Computer Vision Systems for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. The team cleared the first two rounds of&nbsp;<strong>SAVe (Student AUV Competition) 2019</strong>&nbsp;at NIOT Madras. Apart from that, I was a part of the team which got selected for the&nbsp;<strong>Student Design Competition held at the ACM/IEEE Conference held at California for building an autonomous voice controlled wheelchair</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yz_HJX_NBeCua_TdEA2wiVtxrSqzi-1n/view?usp=sharing">Paper</a>). I have also worked on designing and fabrication of a mind-controlled bionic arm which is now able to replicate up to six different human hand motions robustly (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qJsMmV2c6lBgH_x_exNYfi8vmoVyx0UY/view?usp=sharing">Report</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v7CtJHJ51Zo22X3yqgIJ-3eBY8tkrZnF?usp=sharing">Video</a>).&nbsp;<strong>My project of the Bionic Arm is incubated at the Cisco IoT Lab at IIT-BHU. I am also hoping to publish my work at IIIT-Hyderabad at a workshop at CVPR.</strong></p>
<p>I also love reading and implementing interesting research papers in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have designed and implemented an innovative image enhancement architecture for colour (RGB) images using the concept of&nbsp;<strong>Deep Autoencoders</strong>.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/joeljosephjin/llnet_implementation">Github</a></p>
<p>I am an ardent believer of &lsquo;learn by doing&rsquo; which led me to pick up projects one after another since my freshman year. Eventually, I discovered my passion for solving practical problems using technology.</p>
<p>I came across your work in the field of Computer Vision which I really enjoyed reading and discussing with my peers here. Apart from that, I have read some of your leading work and am really intrigued by your publications. I hope to contribute to your projects, through my experiences at the Robotics Club as well as from working on a wide array of projects.<br /><br /> I am considering to apply for a Ph.D. in this domain. An exceptional research project at this stage would augment my grasp of this domain and become a milestone in my career.<br /><br /> I would love to know if your lab has any openings for undergraduate students in the duration of&nbsp;<strong>May - Aug 2020</strong>. Kindly consider my application for a research internship during the said period under your able guidance.<br /><br /> Please find attached, my Resume and my Github profile, Academic References/Recommendations can be provided if needed.<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FagzKDZ3suWR-vmEVGiGPZ04cZ3kw3Td/view?usp=sharing">Resume</a><br /><a href="http://github.com/joeljosephjin">Github</a><br /><br /><br /> Sincerely,<br /> Joel Joseph<br /> Junior Undergraduate<br /> IIT BHU(Indian Institute Of Technology(Banaras Hindu University), Varanasi</p>
